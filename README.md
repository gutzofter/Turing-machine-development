### **Status Update - Version 0.2.11**

**Overview:**
- Current focus: Developing Turing Machine Development (TMD) system from initial design to integrated circuit (IC) fabrication.

**Topics:**
1. **Finite Automata and Logic Gates:** Transition tables for different bit sizes converted to logic gates and Verilog.
2. **LUT Calculations:** Calculated LUTs for various bit-sized state machines.
3. **TMD Assembly for Sine Wave Processing:** Created BIOS and library calls in TMD assembly.
4. **Library Design Principles:** Implemented single responsibility principle in TMD code for sine wave and DAC libraries.
5. **High-Speed Bus Research:** Task added to research high-speed buses for running multiple processors on the same silicon.
