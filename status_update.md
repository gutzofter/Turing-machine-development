Certainly! Here's a summary of the logic constraints for the Status Update, Action Items List, Topics, and other components:

### **Logic Constraints**

**Status Update:**

1. **Versioning:**
   - Each update increments the minor version number.
   - Changes in functionality or structure lead to version updates.

2. **Prompt for Changes:**
   - When modifications are made, prompt: "Do you wish to see the changes?".
   - Display the updated Status Update if "Yes"; otherwise, no display.

3. **Action Item Status Display:**
   - Only "Working" status items are highlighted.
   - Status is displayed in front of the action item description only if it is "Working".
   - All action items are listed, but only those with "Working" status are highlighted.

4. **Action Item List Versioning:**
   - Action Item List should have a version number, incremented with each change.

**Action Items List:**

1. **Unique Working Status:**
   - Only one action item across all categories can be in the "Working" status at any time.

2. **Status Display Logic:**
   - Status is displayed in front of the action item description only if the status is "Working".
   - Status labels for "Hold," "Inactive," and others are not shown.

**Topics:**

1. **Display Order:**
   - Topics are listed before the Action Items List in the Status Update.

By adhering to these constraints, the Status Update remains organized and relevant, providing clear visibility into ongoing work while maintaining a structured format.
